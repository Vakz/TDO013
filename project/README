mongodb
-------
IDs are generated using ObjectID, but are stored as strings, simply because it's easier than keeping track and making sure to cast it back and forth. I feel that it's worth the tradeoff of 12 extra bytes to store.

Sessions
---------
Sessions are built using client-sessions. In order to revoke all sessions from server side, a token is used in accordance to this blog post:
